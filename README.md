HTML and PHP files using SQL to create a database where users can sign in, make recipes, and buy them from the store. (2021)

This was my first time using PHP and HTML, and my first semester learning SQL. Probably one of my favorite projects 
from this semester, but there is still room for much growth for these type of projects. I completed this project in 1 week.
